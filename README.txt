Pakakumi Data Scraper
This Python script scrapes data from the Pakakumi website and saves the results into a CSV file. It automates the browser using Selenium and the Chrome WebDriver.

Features
Scrapes the latest game data from the Pakakumi website.
Saves the extracted data as a CSV file.
Automated browser interaction using the Selenium package.
Configured to use the latest version of the Chrome WebDriver.
Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Google Chrome (Latest version)
Chrome WebDriver (Make sure the version matches your installed Chrome browser version)
Python dependencies (listed in the requirements.txt)
Setup
1. Install Python Dependencies
First, install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Hereâ€™s an example of the required libraries (make sure they are added to your requirements.txt file):

text
Copy code
selenium
pandas
2. Download Chrome WebDriver
The Chrome WebDriver must match your installed Chrome browser version.

Download Chrome WebDriver corresponding to your version of Chrome.
Extract the WebDriver and place it in a directory accessible by the script (e.g., the same folder as your script or add it to your system PATH).
You can verify your Chrome version by visiting chrome://settings/help in your Chrome browser.

3. Setup Chrome WebDriver Path
In your Python script, ensure the Chrome WebDriver path is correctly set. Here is an example of how to set up the WebDriver path in the script:

python
Copy code
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

# Define the path to your ChromeDriver
chrome_driver_path = "/path/to/chromedriver"

# Create a service object for ChromeDriver
service = Service(chrome_driver_path)

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)
Replace "/path/to/chromedriver" with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable.

4. Run the Script
Once the dependencies are installed, the Chrome WebDriver is set up, and you've ensured the path to ChromeDriver is correct, you can run the script:

bash
Copy code
python scrap.py
5. Saving Data to CSV
The script will automatically scrape the data from the Pakakumi website and save it into a CSV file. By default, the file will be saved in the same directory as the script, but you can modify the script to change the save location.

Example of how data is saved in the script:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a list of dictionaries with scraped data
data = [
    {"column1": "value1", "column2": "value2"},
    {"column1": "value3", "column2": "value4"},
]

# Convert data to a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Save DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv('pakakumi_data.csv', index=False)
Notes
Ensure your Chrome browser and ChromeDriver versions match. You can check your Chrome version by navigating to chrome://settings/help in the browser.
Modify the script as needed to suit your data extraction needs.
Troubleshooting
ChromeDriver Version Mismatch: If you encounter errors related to ChromeDriver, ensure that the ChromeDriver version matches your installed version of Chrome.

WebDriverException: Ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is accessible. You may need to add the ChromeDriver to your system PATH.
